For more info, go to the official [website](https://larbs.xyz), or directly to the Github pages: [script](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/LARBS) and [dot files](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/voidrice).

## List of changes

- Reverted the option to install i3 version
- (!) All programs that use vim movement keys have k and j swapped (j for 'up' and k for 'down'), for gamer muscle memory dies hard
- Added font support to accomodate the maximum number of languages and writing systems (East Asian hieroglyphs, Afro-Asiatic/Semitic scripts, etc. ), as befits a proper linguist
- Some stylistic changes in dotfiless
